/**
 * Regular expressions are a way to describe patterns in string data.
 * They form a small separate language that is part of JS and many other languages and systems.
 * 
 * The regular expression is a type of object. 
 * It can be constructed with the RegExp constructor or written as a literal value by enclosing a pattern in /'s.
